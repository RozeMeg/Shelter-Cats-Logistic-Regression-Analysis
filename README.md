# Shelter-Cats-Logistic-Regression-Analysis

This project investigated factors related to likelihood of shelter cat adoption using the openly provided Austin Animal Center Outcomes dataset.
This was the final project for my Linear/Logistic regression class. 

I recommend looking through the PDF slides for a more concise summary of the analysis and findings, the code if you want to see that I can clean and analyze data
in R, and the paper if you need a writing sample/something to put you to sleep.
